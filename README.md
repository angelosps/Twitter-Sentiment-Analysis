# Twitter Sentiment Analysis üëçüëé 

Neural Network models that classify tweets as _positive_ or _negative_ using various methods.  
The dataset is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dTIWNpjlrnTQBIQtaGOh0jCRYZiAQO79/view).  

## Models implemented
- Feed Forward Neural Network
  - with TF-IDF feature generation scheme
  - with GloVe pre-trained word embeddings 
- Recurrent Neural Networks *with GloVe pre-trained word embeddings*
  - with GRU cells
  - with LSTM cells


In the following table I include the links to Google Colaboratory for the various models.  
The _ipynb_ files are included in this repository as well.
Each notebook is fully documented.
